-- 1. The names and the number of messages sent by each user 

SELECT 
  a.Name,
  count(b.MessageID) Messages 
FROM User a 
JOIN Messages b on a.UserID = b.UserIDSender
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 


-- 2. The total number of messages sent stratified by weekday

SELECT 
  DAYNAME(DATE(DateSent)) as Weekday,
  COUNT(MessageID) as TotalMessages, 
  ROUND(COUNT(MessageID) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(MessageID) FROM Messages), 2) AS PercentageOfTotal
FROM Messages 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY FIELD(Weekday,'SUNDAY','MONDAY','TUESDAY','WEDNESDAY','THURSDAY','FRIDAY','SATURDAY'); 

/*
In this solution, I also recommend adding a column showing the percentage of the total.
This would help stakeholders quickly identify the most popular day and easily compare values, such as Sunday at 10% versus Tuesday at 20%.
Here is an example output:
| Weekday   | TotalMessages | PercentageOfTotal|
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Sunday    | 150           | 10.25%           |
| Monday    | 250           | 17.10%           |
| Tuesday   | 300           | 20.50%           |
| Wednesday | 220           | 15.07%           |
| Thursday  | 180           | 12.32%           |
| Friday    | 280           | 19.18%           |
| Saturday  | 120           | 8.58%            | 

Why Should You Cast DateSent to DATE?
Without Casting: The DAYNAME() function works directly on DATETIME, but it still processes the time component internally.
With Casting: Using CAST(DateSent AS DATE) or DATE(DateSent) makes the query more efficient and clear, especially for large datasets.

-- 3. The most recent message from each thread that has no response yet

/*
Reasoning Behind the Code:
I assume that a message thread always begins with a sender. Based on this, I have introduced the thread status "No response â€“ Single message" to account for cases where no reply has been received.

I assume there are two types of unanswered threads:

Waiting for a response from the recipient (when the sender sent the last message), and
Waiting for a response from the sender (when the recipient sent the last message).
In a real-world scenario, I would conduct further exploration and potentially analyse the content of the final message to determine whether a response is actually expected. For example, phrases like "Thank you", "Got it", or "No worries" could indicate that the conversation is resolved and does not require a response. This could be enhanced using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automate the identification of such phrases.

I could also expand the analysis by calculating response rates over time to identify behavioural trends. For example:

(Latest thread by sender / Total messages sent by sender) and
(Latest thread by recipient / Total messages sent by recipient)
These metrics could be tracked as a time series to observe patterns and identify changes over time. This approach could help detect seasonal trends, sudden shifts in communication behaviour, and long-term improvements or declines in response rates.

-- 4. For the conversation with the most messages: all user data and message contents ordered chronologically so one can follow the whole conversation

WITH ThreadMessageCounts AS (
    SELECT ThreadID, COUNT(MessageID) AS MessageCount
    FROM Messages
    GROUP BY ThreadID
    ORDER BY MessageCount DESC
    LIMIT 1
),
RankedMessages AS (
    SELECT 
        a.ThreadID,
        a.MessageID,
        u_sender.Name AS Sender,
        u_recipient.Name AS Recipient,
        a.MessageContent,
        a.DateSent,
        LAG(a.DateSent) OVER (PARTITION BY a.ThreadID ORDER BY a.DateSent ASC) AS PreviousDateSent
    FROM Messages a
    JOIN User u_sender ON a.UserIDSender = u_sender.UserID
    JOIN User u_recipient ON a.UserIDRecipient = u_recipient.UserID
    WHERE a.ThreadID = (SELECT ThreadID FROM ThreadMessageCounts)
)
SELECT 
    ThreadID,
    MessageID,
    Sender,
    Recipient,
    MessageContent,
    DateSent,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, PreviousDateSent, DateSent) AS ResponseTimeInSeconds
FROM RankedMessages
ORDER BY DATE(DateSent) ASC;


/*
In this solution, I propose to also show response time. Some benefits to include this are 
- Conversation Flow: Reveals how quickly users respond, which can indicate engagement and urgency.
- User Engagement: Longer response times might indicate lower engagement or delayed conversations.
- Performance Tracking: Can help monitor whether users are responding within an expected timeframe. 

Potential output can look like the below: 
| ThreadID  |  MessageID    |      Sender| Recipient     | MessageContent                            | DateSent                 | ResponseTimeInSeconds    |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
